# Kaggle-Titanic-Survivor
This project is based on two datasets of train and test. The train dataset is of 891 items with 12 variables, and we want to make prediction on “survived” of test dataset.  


On April 15, 1912, the RMS Titanic sank resulting in the loss of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

The goal here is to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive in this disaster.

We can use the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

This repository is  an example of how to do it.
